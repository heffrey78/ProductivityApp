# Fix Recording Player and Transcription Issues Plan

## Current Problems

1. **Missing Play Button**: The play button exists in the code (line 313-323 in RecordingPlayer.tsx) but may not be visible due to styling issues or the component taking up too much space.

2. **Automatic Transcription Not Happening**: The transcription does not happens.

3. **Missing Transcription Button**: There is no visible transcription button for manual transcription.

4. **Scrolling Issues**: Multiple recordings cannot be scrolled because the RecordingPlayer component takes up too much space, and the recordings list container doesn't have proper scroll handling.

5. **Wrong Speech Recognition Method**: Currently using expo-speech-recognition (Google's cloud-based service) instead of the requested on-device Whisper model.

## Root Causes

1. **UI Space Issue**: The RecordingPlayer component has extensive UI for transcription that takes up significant space
2. **Container Layout**: The `recordingsList` style only has `gap` property, no proper height constraints or scroll behavior
3. **Speech Recognition Pivot**: Changed from Whisper to expo-speech-recognition without approval due to build issues

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Fix UI Layout and Scrolling Issues

#### A. Reduce RecordingPlayer Height
- Make the transcription section collapsible by default
- Add a toggle button to expand/collapse transcription details
- Reduce padding and margins in the component
- Consider a more compact layout for the player controls

#### B. Fix ScrollView for Recordings List
- Add proper height constraints to the recordings section
- Ensure the ScrollView in NoteEditorScreen properly contains the recordings
- Add `flexShrink: 1` to prevent recordings from expanding infinitely
- Test with multiple recordings to ensure smooth scrolling

### 2. Restore Whisper Integration

#### A. Fix whisper.rn Build Issues
The original error was: "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../node_modules/whisper.rn/cpp/amx/amx.cpp'"

Potential solutions:
1. **Try react-native-whisper instead of whisper.rn**
   - More actively maintained
   - Better documentation
   - May have fixed the build issues

2. **Use whisper.cpp with custom bindings**
   - Direct integration with whisper.cpp
   - More control over the build process
   - Can specify exact model files

3. **Patch whisper.rn**
   - Create the missing directories/files
   - Use patch-package to maintain the fix

#### B. Implementation Plan for Whisper
1. Remove expo-speech-recognition
2. Install and configure chosen Whisper library
3. Update TranscriptionService to use actual Whisper API
4. Implement model download/management UI
5. Add progress indicators for transcription

### 3. Add Automatic Transcription Option

#### A. Add Settings
- Add a toggle in RecordingPlayer for "Auto-transcribe on save"
- Store preference in the database or AsyncStorage
- Show loading state immediately after recording completes

#### B. Implement Auto-transcription
- Trigger transcription automatically when recording is saved
- Queue multiple transcriptions if needed
- Show progress in a non-intrusive way

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Fix UI Issues (Immediate)
1. **Modify RecordingPlayer.tsx**:
   - Add collapsible transcription section
   - Reduce component height
   - Ensure play button is always visible
   - Make layout more compact

2. **Fix NoteEditorScreen.tsx**:
   - Add height constraints to recordings section
   - Wrap recordings list in proper ScrollView
   - Add `maxHeight` to prevent overflow

### Phase 2: Restore Whisper (After UI fixes)
1. Research and select best Whisper library for React Native
2. Remove expo-speech-recognition
3. Install and configure Whisper library
4. Update TranscriptionService
5. Test on device

### Phase 3: Add Auto-transcription (After Whisper works)
1. Add settings UI for auto-transcription
2. Implement automatic triggering
3. Add queue management for multiple recordings
4. Test edge cases

## Alternative Quick Fix (If Whisper integration is blocking)

If Whisper integration continues to have issues, we could:
1. Use a hybrid approach:
   - Keep expo-speech-recognition for live speech-to-text in notes
   - Use react-native-fs + fetch to send audio files to a Whisper API endpoint
   - This would work but requires internet connection

2. Wait for whisper.rn updates:
   - The library is relatively new
   - Build issues might be fixed in upcoming versions

## Testing Plan

1. Create 5+ recordings in a single note
2. Verify all recordings are visible and scrollable
3. Test play/pause functionality on each recording
4. Test transcription on different audio lengths
5. Verify UI remains responsive with multiple transcriptions

## Priority Order

1. **HIGH**: Fix scrolling and UI layout issues (users can't see their recordings)
2. **HIGH**: Ensure play button is visible and functional
3. **MEDIUM**: Implement proper Whisper integration
4. **LOW**: Add automatic transcription feature

## Questions for User

1. Would you prefer to fix the UI issues first, then tackle Whisper integration? OK.
2. Is internet connectivity acceptable for transcription, or must it be 100% offline? TRANSCRIPTION MUST BE 100% OFFLINE!!!
3. Would you accept a temporary solution while we work on proper Whisper integration? NO!!!
4. What's the maximum recording length you expect users to create? IT SHOULDN'T MATTER. USE CHUNKING OR SOME OTHER STRATEGY FOR LONG RUNNING RECORDINGS. IF THERE IS A HARD LIMIT, USE THAT.
